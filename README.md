ETKG has following characteristics:
1. The graph is centered on the activities that tourists have participated in during the trips and regard uses tourists' trajectories as carriers. Therefore, we can solve users' questions about activities and routes during the trip.
2. The graph supports W3C standard(RDF, SPARKQL).
3. In practice, not only can the graph be used to search for the answers of touristsâ€™ question directly (QA), but it help us to summarize knowledge at a deeper level. The information can be used as a prior knowledge when we analyze the behavior of tourists (RS).
We can get some transfer relationship is as follows(reveal Spatiotemporal relationship).
